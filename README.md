Decision Tree About Dataset

Imagine you are a medical researcher compiling data for a study. You have collected data on a series of patients, all suffering from the same disease. Throughout their course of treatment, each patient responded to one of 5 drugs: Drug A, Drug B, Drug C, Drug X and y.
    
Part of your job is to build a model to find out which drug might be suitable for a future patient with the same disease. The characteristics of this dataset are Age, Gender, Blood Pressure and Cholesterol of the patients and the target is the drug that each patient responds to.

This is an example of a multiclass classifier and you can use the training part of the dataset 
Building a decision tree and then using it to predict the class of an unknown patient or prescribe medication to a new patient.
